# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data

Getting and Cleaning Data Project

Repo for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

Overview

This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository
The source data for this project can be found here.

Data processing steps

1. The source data mentioned above must be provided in the working directory ("C:/Users/[User]/Documents/DataScience/03 Getting and Cleaning Data/03 Data/UCI HAR Dataset")
2. The R script run_analysis.R needs to run to produce a tidy data set performing following steps: 
    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
3. The final result after step 5 – a tidy data set - will be provided in the working directory. The file is called tidyData.txt and the columns are tab-separated.
